Data:
    There are two json files which are given: layout and order.
    The layout consists out of a pickup-point (also the starting point) from which the drinks should be picked up. The second thing that is specified is de starting direction of the deliver bot.
    Points are specified in the following way:
    - x: x position of the point, mainly for graphical representation
    - y: y position of the point, mainly for graphical representation
    - east, south, west, north: connected point in respective wind direction.
    The example layout corresponds with the following representation:
    
    ```
    a - b
    |   |
    |   |
    d - c -- e
    ```

    Note that there can be dead-ends! And also see the example jpeg for a real life example.

    Than in `order.json` the drinks order is specified. Consisting out of the point where the customer is and the amount of drinks.  


Rules of ordering:
    The robot can carry up to five drinks at once, and may do partial drop offs. It can pick up new drinks at the pick up point (where you start).
    
    The drinks can be delivered in whatever order is the quickest.

    When picking up or delivering an order, the robot needs to pause for 1 second.

    Your visualization should (at least!) make it clear how many drinks your robot is currently carrying.

    Optionally your team may choose to do the demo with a blockade, meaning a physical obstacle will be placed on one of the lines, and your robot will need to route around it.
